<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I participated in Angelhack's annual hackathon in June of 2016 at IBM. The team consisted of myself and a friend. Our idea was to develop and app that allows you to aggregate all of your online dating activity. The premise was that we were already" swiping right" and "liking" profiles in mass quantity (in the old spray and pray approach). So our thought was why not automate that! This was my first hackathon as The Designer so while my friend worked on scraping Tinder I had a lot of fun imagining what an aggregation app like this could look like. </p>

<h2>What I Built</h2>

<p>I built animated screens using Principle. <i>At this time, I had not yet learned Sketch and I didn't own the program.</i> The app is designed to consolidate your matches. So everything from profiles to messages is consolidated is an easy to use workflow. Nearly every dating app has a mutual like function that helps to indicate interest. But as a user, I only want to message those that have reciprocated my interest.</p>

<h2>Barriers</h2>
<p>The biggest barrier was my workflow. Not incorporating Sketch into the process meant that I spend a lot of extra time designing assets.</p>

<h2>Shortcomings</h2>
<p>This design is really just a skeleton. But being my first app design, I'm happy with it.</p>

<h2>Further Work</h2>
<p>If I were to extend this I would spend time working on the profile grid. Circle heads are kinda weak. What if someone doesn't care about pictures and wants to read profiles? Most dating apps are picture driven and so I think there's an opportunity to focus on the writing and personality of someone.</p>
