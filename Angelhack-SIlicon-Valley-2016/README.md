<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>I participated in Angelhack's annual hackathon in June of 2016 at IBM. The team consisted of myself and a friend. Our idea was to develop and app that allows you to aggregate all of your online dating activity. The premise was that we were already" swiping right" and "liking" profiles in mass quantity (in the old spray and pray approach). So our thought was why not automate that! This was my first hackathon as The Designer so while my friend worked on scraping Tinder I had a lot of fun imagining what an aggregation app like this could look like. </p>

<h2>What I Built</h2>

<p>I built animated screens using Principle. At this time, I had not yet learned Sketch and I didn't own the program.</p>
