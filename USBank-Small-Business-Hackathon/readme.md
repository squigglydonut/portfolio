<h2>What I Built</h2>

<h2>Barriers</h2>


<h2>Shortcomings</h2>
The design had too many screens because we had a hard time determining what the core value of our product was. By the end of the event we had successfully trained our algorithm (2 data scientist on our team) but our automatic job application "applyer" worked only on platforms without captcha.

<h2>Further Work</h2>
I think the job market will become 3 things. 
* Applications will aggregate so that an applicants profile gets added "to the pool"
* Companies will know exactly who they need to hire
* Companies will be able to source from the maximum number of applicants

So I think future work would involve consolidating this idea into one of those categories and "solving one problem really well".
