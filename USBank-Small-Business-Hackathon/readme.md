<h2>What I Built</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/squigglydonut/portfolio/blob/master/USBank-Small-Business-Hackathon/imgs/usbankhack.gif"></p>
<p>We built an iOS app that makes paying your bill at a restaurant easy and fun. The game we built demonstrated a gambling scenario where 1 unlucky participant would have to pay the bill for the entire group. We used APIs from Mastercard and US Bank to pull user account info and facilitate transactions. There were three designers on the team. I worked on part of the mountains/desert screen and made all the animations in Principle. I also made the landscape of the beach/trees on the gameplay screen.</p>

<h2>Barriers</h2>
US Bank released a very limited API for the event which used pre-defined account information making it impossible for us to make the app for real. Another barrier is the learning curve to designing for games. While there was three designers on the team, none of us had made a mobile game before.

<h2>Shortcomings</h2>
We had some issues with the final product because most of the design assets were created sunday morning. Storyboarding a game is really hard without playtesting which is something we learned.

<h2>Further Work</h2>
I would definitely like to design more games. Games are fun and spending more time on the assets could really help in making an engaging game.
